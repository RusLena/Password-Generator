# Password-Generator

Overview

The Password Generator is a web application designed to assist users in creating strong and secure passwords. The tool prompts users to specify the length of the password and allows them to select various character types. These character types consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Collaborative Effort

This project presented several challenges for me, and I received invaluable assistance from my tutor, Trinh Nguyen. 
The development of the getPasswordOptions() function was a collaborative effort between a TA, fellow students, and myself during a classroom session.
